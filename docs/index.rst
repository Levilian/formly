`formly` is an app that provides an out of the box solution to building adhoc
forms to collect data from end users. It is multi-faceted in that it provides
interfaces for building multi-page forms, interfaces for executing the survey,
as well as views for reviewing results.

Also, it is non-linear, meaning that you can route users taking the survey to
different pages based on what they answered on certain questions. This allows
you to create very rich surveys that dive deep on detail you care about while
not wasting the time of users who would otherwise have to go through questions
that do not apply to them.

This project is brought to you by Midwest Communications.
